# Sliding-window-analysis

These coding scripts are incomplete but I am currently in the process of creating two sliding window analyses for determining which springtime temperature window best predicts first egg date and clutch size in Blue tits. I am also using a within-subject centering approach within the sliding windows to separate the effects of temperature across spatial and temporal gradients. Finally, I am also adding mean first bud burst of trees at each blue tit nestbox site, and caterpillar abundance (the main food source) to the model to examine the effects of this.
